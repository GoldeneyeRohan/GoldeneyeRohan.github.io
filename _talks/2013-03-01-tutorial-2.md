As president and project-lead of the [Goldeneye](https://goldeneye.berkeley.edu) student engineering team at Berkeley, I had a great time presenting a year's worth of projects in autonomous driving with my teammates at Aptiv. A big shout-out goes to Aptiv for sponsoring our work. The projects we presented and demoed spanned topics in: 
* Vehicle hardware architecture
* Vision based lane-keeping
* Motion Planning
* Obstacle Avoidance 
* Lidar and IMU Sensor fusion algorithms
