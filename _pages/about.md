I am a third year PhD candidate in the department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University, where I am a member of the **[Autonomous Systems Lab](https://stanfordasl.github.io/)** advised by **[Prof. Marco Pavone](https://web.stanford.edu/~pavone/)**. 

My research focuses on developing methodologies that improve the reliability of ML-enabled robotic systems, particularly when these systems encounter **[out-of-distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14020)** conditions with respect to their training data. Broadly, my research interests lie at the intersection of control theory, machine learning, and applied robotics. 

Previously, I received bachelorâ€™s degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley with honors and a distinction in general scholarship. As an undergraduate, I worked on data-driven predictive control under **[Prof. Francesco Borrelli](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/francesco-borrelli/)** in the **[Model Predictive Control Lab](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/mpc-lab/home)** and on learning control algorithms that rely on vision systems under **[Prof. Benjamin Recht](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/)** in the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Lab. I have also interned as an autonomous driving engineer at Delphi (now [Motional](https://motional.com/)) and as a software engineer at Amazon.
