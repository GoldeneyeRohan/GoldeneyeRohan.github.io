I am a 4th year undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, double majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). I grew up in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and lived there untill coming to the United States to attend university three years ago. Currently, I am most interested in robotics and autonomous systems.
