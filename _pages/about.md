I am a 4th year undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, double majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). I grew up in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and lived there untill coming to the United States to attend university three years ago. Currently, I am most interested in robotics and autonomous systems, but have performed research in aerospace design as well. 

I believe that thorough knowledge of an entire autonomous system is integral to its successful implementation: from the vehicle's mechanics and dynamics, to the algorithms that control it and the circuits that drive it. I am currently working on decentralized data-driven control strategies for autonomous racing with multiple agents in the [Model Predictive Control Lab](http://www.mpc.berkeley.edu/) under professor F. Borrelli.
