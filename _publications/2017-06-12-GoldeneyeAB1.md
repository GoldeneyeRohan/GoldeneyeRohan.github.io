"The team's design, named Goldeneye AB1, features a novel variable geometry wing design that allows it to fly efficiently at both supersonic and subsonic speeds, all while maintaining high lift. The participants were invited to present their paper during the winner's symposium at NASA's Langley Research Center from September 25th-26th."
