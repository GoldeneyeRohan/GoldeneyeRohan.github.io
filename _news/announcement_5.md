I presented a tutorial **[Avoiding failures in ML-enabled systems: Tutorial on Runtime Monitoring and Contingency Planning](https://youtu.be/sHu7atL4_c0)** at the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford (CARS). I overviewed recent literature for runtime monitoring and presented some of our recent results. Thanks for the invitation!
