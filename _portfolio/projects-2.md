As the capping project for a graduate course I took on Model Predictive Control, my teammates and I decided to design a control algorithm for multiple quadcopters to lift an object with cables in a decentralized fashion. To simulate this complex task, we implemented a non-linear multi-body simulator using the ROS framework with full 3-D rendered vizualizations in RVIZ.  

As this was a graduate level course, projects were required to puth forth some academic novelty, and as far as I am aware, this is the first instance where a control algorithm has been proposed that can achieve a cooperative heavy lifting task in such an unconstrained fashion.
