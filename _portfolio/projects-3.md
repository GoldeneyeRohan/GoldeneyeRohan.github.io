For the senior capstone design project in Mechanical Engineering, my team and I designed Omni-Directional robots from scratch to complete a cooperative lifting task between human-controlled and autonomous robots. Our project, dubbed OLLY (Oversized Load Lifter and Yielder) was one of the winners of the department's design competition. The full project report and videos are available [here](/files/ME_102B_Project_Olly_Final_Report_Public_Version.pdf), the abstract is given below: 

*The   Oversized   Load   Lifting   and   Yielding   (OLLY)robots carry long extended loads between them. The front robot is controlled by user input, while the rear robot maps the surrounding susing  a  SLAM  algorithm  from  LIDAR  data  and  autonomously follows   the   front   robot   at   a   fixed   distance.   We   implemented two  model-predictive  controllers  to  maintain  robot  distance,  staywithin  road  constraints,  and  minimize  actuation.  A  set  of  three omnidirectional  wheels  allows  the  robots  to  handle  any  velocity command  whether  from  user  input  or  from  controller  output.  Intests, the follower robot was able to hold the loading distance within Â±1inch while (1) turning a corner and (2) staying on a fixed line.*
